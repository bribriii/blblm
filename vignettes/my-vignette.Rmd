### Introduction on package blblm
It is a package that applies BLB on Linear Regression Model and hopefully on Logistic Regression Model as well. There are two main functions `blblm()` and `blbglm()` used for Linear Regression Model and hopefully on Logistic Regression Model respectively. I've only finished `blblm()`, the `blbglm()` is still on progress.
